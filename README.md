## ðŸ“š What New Things I Learned:

### HTML Sanitization

The project uses `sanitize-html` to ensure secure rendering of HTML content. This library helps prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks by cleaning and sanitizing HTML input before rendering it in the application. It removes potentially dangerous HTML tags and attributes while preserving safe content.

### @upstash/ratelimit and @upstash/redis

The @upstash/ratelimit and @upstash/redis packages are commonly used together for rate limiting in serverless.
There use case is

- Enforce API rate limits (e.g., 10 requests per minute per user)
- Prevent abuse of your APIs.

### NUQS
